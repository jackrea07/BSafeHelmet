## Blind-Spot/Crash Detection
For the Pre-Alpha build, the persistent state of polling the ultra-sonic sensor for objects has been developed. The program is able to detect when an object is in range of the sensor. Currently the math for how far away the object is has not been developed properly, we will work on that for the next milestone. Additionally, we have interfaced with an IMU to grab accelerometer and gyroscope data. This exact accelerometer will need to be tested in the near future to determine if it has high enough quality for the finished product. Lastly, we have a RTOS to run the future program on. All we need to do is add proper threads.
